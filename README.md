* [Part 0 - Introduction andÂ Overview](https://blog.thepolyglotprogrammer.com/)

## Project Overview

Marvin Blockchain is a distributed ledger inspired by Bitcoin, implemented in Go. This project aims to provide a robust and scalable blockchain solution while comparing the nuances of building the same system in Rust.

## Features (WIP)

- **Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus Mechanism**
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking**
- **Transaction and Block Validation**
- **Smart Contract Support via EVM Compatibility**
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests and Benchmarks**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/joaoh82/marvin-blockchain-go.git
cd marvin-blockchain-go
```

2. Install dependencies:
```sh
go mod tidy
```

3. Build the project:
```sh
go build -o marvin-blockchain-go
```

### Running the Blockchain
To start a node on the Marvin Blockchain:
```sh
./marvin-blockchain-go
```

### Running Tests
To run the unit tests:
```sh
go test ./...
```
